# AppBase

This is an engine for TheOpenCMS which contains all basic application's files (Controllers, Views, Models etc.)

If you want to deeply customize TheOpenCMS, probably, you have to remove this engine from the App and create a new one engine based on this one.

Customization process didn't design and describe yet. It's a task for the nearest future.
