# SimpleSort

Gem provides simple sort on Active Record collections.

# How it works

Add `SimpleSort` functionality to your Model

```ruby
class Product  < ApplicationRecord
  include ::SimpleSort::Base
end
```

Use method `simple_sort` with your Model in a controller like this:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.simple_sort(params)
  end
end
```

* Use `simple_sort_url` helper in your views to provide sorting for required field
* Use `reset_simple_sort` helper to reset current sort params

```ruby
= link_to 'Reset sort params', url_for(reset_simple_sort)

= link_to 'Title ↕',      simple_sort_url(:title)
= link_to 'Created At ↕', simple_sort_url(:crated_at)
= link_to 'Updated At ↕', simple_sort_url(:updated_at)
```

# Bonus methods for Models

Also gem provides some dead-simple but helpful methods

* `max2min` for descending order `DESC` (1000, 102, 15, 3)
* `min2max` for ascending order `ASC` (3, 15, 102, 1000)
* `random` random record from a database (`mysql`, `psql`)

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.max2min(:created_at)
    @articles = Article.min2max(:title)
    @banners  = Banner.random.limit(3)
  end
end
```
